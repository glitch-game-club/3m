This course is built on the simple idea of starting with a platform game and adding familiar game patterns and features. One fun way to do this is to remix this [starting template of a Platform Game](https://makecode.com/_6630XRAuUePh)
by adding in different features which we call [Game Patterns](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/gamePatterns). This technique of modifying an existing half-baked game is a great way for novice coders to get a head start and to see big changes in the game when they change the existing code.

Another way is to *make the template game from scratch* right from the beginning or if you want to understand how all sections of the code work. This is a good thing to do if you are getting confused about how the structure of the game works.

Finally, you may start off by remixing and add in a game patterns to the incomplete template game and then decide you want to know how the underlying structure and core game patterns work. In this way you'll be able to meet yourself in the middle.

This resource section references core patterns to bring you a complete picture and understanding of the whole of how your code works. There are two main ways of doing this a quick online interactive tutorial, and a more in-depth resource themed around core game patterns.  

### Online Interactive Tutorial
Make Code has a tutorial system which gives you step by step help as you add in code blocks in the Make Code website. Try this [interactive tutorial to create the platform template game from scratch M- part one](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/tutorialPartOne) and [part two of the tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101C/tutorialPartTwo)

### Starting your Game Code with Core Patterns

These patterns are quite foundational

Jump to patterns;

- On Start - creating the starting world  
- Game Loops - update block
- Player Movement - as user input inside the game loop
- Collision Detection - a common pattern in computing
- Game States - play is the default state - win and lose are built in
