# Learn Core Design Patterns of a Platformer

## Starting your Game Code with Core Patterns

[updated template to suit core patterns](https://makecode.com/_24RHVmi9kY44)

The following patterns are used to create our starting game template. When we have completed them we can add all sorts of other [Game Patterns](../gamePatterns.md)

- [Building the Game World](onStart.md)   
- Game (Update) Loop - including including as user input inside the game loop
- Game Mechanic Collecting
- Add an End Goal
- Using Game States - play is the default state - win and lose are built in

In later sections these kids of game patterns are themed into mechanics patterns, game space patterns, game polish patterns and challenge patterns. For now they are ordered in a easy to build way.   

## Meeting Yourself in the Middle

This course is built on the simple idea of starting with a platform game and adding familiar game patterns and features. One fun way to do this is to remix this [starting template of a Platform Game](https://makecode.com/_6630XRAuUePh)
by adding in different features which we call [Game Patterns](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/gamePatterns). This technique of modifying an existing half-baked game is a great way for novice coders to get a head start and to see big changes in the game when they change the existing code.

Another way is to *make the template game from scratch* right from the beginning or if you want to understand how all sections of the code work. This is a good thing to do if you are getting confused about how the structure of the game works.

Finally, you may start off by remixing and add in a game patterns to the incomplete template game and then decide you want to know how the underlying structure and core game patterns work. In this way you'll be able to meet yourself in the middle.

This resource section references core patterns to bring you a complete picture and understanding of the whole of how your code works. There are two main ways of doing this a quick online interactive tutorial, and a more in-depth resource themed around core game patterns.  

### Online Interactive Tutorial
Make Code has a tutorial system which gives you step by step help as you add in code blocks in the Make Code website. Try this [interactive tutorial to create the platform template game from scratch](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/fullTutorial)
