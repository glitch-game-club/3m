# Remixing a Platformer Game - Collect Points

In this tutorial we will add **point collection** to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

## About this Game Pattern

![collect points](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/master/images/patterns/gameMechanics_more_levels.jpg)

* **Name:** Collect Points

* **Description:** The player is able to increase their score by collecting food or stars or other tokens.

* **Need for Pattern:** Having the ability to **collect points** is a way of increasing player motivation and adding depth to a platformer level.
For example when a player is replaying a game they may try to maximise the number of points they collect rather than just having a goal to
progress as far as possible in levels.

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. For example, does your point score only increase by one (or your chosen number) as you progress

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts.
Find more on the [Game Pattern page](gamePatterns.md).

Some next steps you might want to add player lives or some kind of enemy if you haven't already.
