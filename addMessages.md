# Remixing a Platformer Game - Add Written Messages 

In this tutorial we will learn how to **add written messages** to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/mca_platformer_tutorial/tutorialPartOne)
 to create the game step by step.

## About this Game Pattern

![mechanics space polish and systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/master/images/patterns/gameMechanics_more_levels.jpg)

* **Name:** Add Written Messages

* **Description:** The maker can show to the player at the start of the game. You can also add messages when something happens in the game.  

* **Need for Pattern:** Having **written messages** is a way of giving playing instructions to the player at the start of the game, giving
them clues as they progress or just making the game more fun to play.

* **Related Game Patterns:** Add Graphical Elements [related]

* **Coding Concepts involved:** [Data](learningDimensions#data), [Events](learningDimensions#events)

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** , [Change Listener](learningDimensions#change-listener)

## How to implement this Pattern in MakeCode

### Step by Step instructions

Find the splash block under the Game section and drag one or more blocks to the beginning of the on start block.

You can also get your player to say something when an event happens. For example lets get the player to say Yum when collecting an apple.

Alter the overlap event code block to add in a sprite say block and set the time.

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. For example,  
you can ask yourself the following questions:

* Check your messages aren't too long and disappear of the side of the screen
* Check that the messages appear in the right place

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts.
