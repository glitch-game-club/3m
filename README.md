# Learn Game Design Patterns by Remixing a MakeCode Platformer

### Introduction

This course is built on the simple idea of starting with a platform game and adding familiar
game patterns and features.


One way to learn coding in depth is to learn how to *make the sample game from scratch* and you can do that by following this 
*[Tutorial to create game from scratch Part One](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/partOne)* and [Part Two](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/tutorialPartTwo)

Another fun way is to remix this [starting template of a Platform Game](https://makecode.com/_6630XRAuUePh)
by adding in different features which we call [Game Patterns](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/gamePatterns)

This intention of this course is not to teach the underlying concepts of computer science from first principles.
Here the idea is to build competency with the practicalities of using the coding tool. 
In an art studio students start by experimenting with materials and getting to know their tools first. Large concepts come later.
