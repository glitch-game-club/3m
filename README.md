# Learn Game Design Patterns by Remixing a MakeCode Platformer

### Introduction

This course is built on the simple idea of starting with a platform game and adding familiar
game patterns and features.

A good starting point is this templage to remix from.

One way to learn coding in depth is to learn how to *make the sample game from scratch* and you can do that
in the next section called *Tutorial to create game from scratch*. Another fun way is to keep adding in different game patterns. There are many ways of thinking about these patterns but in this guide we are dividing them up into the following:

These tutorials build up the platform game in a step by step way. Follow them to learn
the mechanics of the building blocks of the make code system.

This intention is not to teach the underlying concepts of computer science all in go.
Here the idea is to build competency with the practicalities of using the coding tool. In an art studio students start by experimenting with materials and getting to know their tools first. Large concepts come later.
