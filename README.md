# Learn Game Design Patterns by Remixing a MakeCode Platformer

## Summary
This course is built on the simple idea of starting with a platform game and adding familiar
game patterns and features.

One way to learn coding in depth is to learn how to *make the sample game from scratch* and you can do that by following this 
*[Tutorial to create game from scratch Part One](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/partOne)* and [Part Two](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/tutorialPartTwo)

Another fun way is to remix this [starting template of a Platform Game](https://makecode.com/_6630XRAuUePh)
by adding in different features which we call [Game Patterns](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/gamePatterns)

## Course Materials
There is material here for a five session course on game making. This takes two forms:

* [Session Materials to run with a group of participants](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/groupCourse)
* [An online course you can work through by yourself](https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/onlineCourse)

## Ideas behind this Course

### Learning via Hands-on Tinkering
This intention of this course is not to teach the underlying concepts of computer science from first principles.
Here the idea is to build competency with the practicalities of using the coding tool. 
In an art studio students start by experimenting with materials and getting to know their tools first. Large concepts come later.  

### Starting with the Familiar, Zoom In to Detail, Zoom out to Wider Patterns
