# Remixing a Platformer Game - Add More Levels

## Add More Levels
### Introduction 

In this tutorial we will **add more levels** to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

#### About this Game Pattern

This game pattern is one of many you can add to your Platformer in this course.

* **Name:** Add More Levels

* **Description:** The player reaches the goal of the first Level of the platformer and then progresses to the next level (and beyond)

* **Need for Pattern:** Having more than one level is a way increasing the length and challenge of the game. You can also bring other elements
of design and even game mechanics to new levels.

* **Coding Concepts involved:** [Data](codingConcepts#data), [Change Listener](widerPatterns#change-listener)

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** [Systems Dynamics](widerPatterns#systems-dynamics),


### Changing our Change Listener  
In our game we have a listner which is always checking to see if there is an overlap between our Player and the Goal Sprite.  

### Change the overlap loop for our Enemy @fullscreen
In this game previously the player overlapping with an Enemy would be Game Over with the player losing.
Now let's change to replace the Game Over lose block with a ``||info:change lives by -1 ||`` block


## Test your game and Next Steps
### Test your game and Next Steps @unplugged
**This tutorial is now complete.**

You can test your game to check that each time you touch .

This tutorial is one of many allowing you add different Game Element on the home page of this Platformer Making Course.
