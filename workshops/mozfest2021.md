# WorkShop Planning

## Background

At a previous Moz fest we ran a successful session using a [template game to change](https://glitch.com/~grid-game-template) - and working with participants to offer them [choices of small missions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iL9fPP_ntsktGyBpX7u7-kTCnFuCDjdR/view) to add or change existing game patterns to shape the game to their own liking. An overview of the process is outlined here more or less.

This had the advantage of being able to draw people into the game making space and get then started without a preamble. The disadvantage is that they didn't get a an overall picture of the aims of this approach or a picture of the wider game making program - which they would have got if we had given them the intro of our game making activities that we had planned. It also lead to a sense of the session just kind of trailing off, which was organic and suited the space, but probably wouldn't work online well.

Feedback given at the event was that it was a really engaging and useful session and that the organisers of the space liked the gentleness of our facilitation. I liked that feedback as often in those youth sessions there is a lot of overly enthusiastic facilitator input at the start which can go on for a bit (I've been guilty of that too)

## Updated Context

Since that session and in response to later game making sessions I've created the following resources for game making in glitch and phaser but also for the newer MakeCode Arcade system

### Phaser / Glitch resources
- a list of [game patterns to add themed by mechanic, space and polish](https://ggc-examples.glitch.me/)
- a book with a tutorial covering how to make the starting template and detail on coding constructs and concepts and some guidance on facilitation (intentionally minimal)

### MakeCode Arcade resources

- a list of [game patterns to add themed by mechanic, space, polish AND challenge/systems ](https://mca-platformer-examples.glitch.me/)
- a landing page for these resources and how to use them (https://mickfuzz.github.io/makecode-platformer-101/)
- [a step by step tutorial using the MakeCode system](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/mca_platformer_tutorial/tutorialPartOne) (which seems to be broken now) 


## Global Aims of the Session

- Give participants a fun experience encouraging them to follow up game making as a way of learning coding and more
- Hand on experience of one or more game making tools
- Share the location and potential of some of resources listed above
- Invite others to feedback and test them
