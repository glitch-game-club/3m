# Wider Patterns and Concepts

These wider patterns and concepts are a way to learn about wider computing practices that are also applicable beyond the world of making games. These ideas are common in the following areas.

* Interactive Media Design
* Object Oriented Programming
* Systems Thinking

## Change Listener

### About this Pattern / Concept

* **Name:** Change Listener

* **Description:** Also known as States, this pattern is useful when you want one part of your programme to listen out for changes in the stage of another. An example would be listening for an overlap between the player and an enemy. The programme can then take action when this overlap change happens or a particular condition is true.

* **Why is it needed :** In many media programmes you need to change formatting or to make something happen based on the conditions of other objects.

* **Examples in MakeCode:** Here are one or more examples of a Change Listener in  MakeCode
  - listening for the player being in a condition of overlap with an Enemy
  - changing the animation of a player based on if they are still, moving or jumping

## Input Event

### About this Pattern / Concept

* **Name:** Input Event

* **Description:** Also known as an event handler, this allows do something like use the keyboard or use the mouse and for your programme to do something in response.

* **Need for Pattern:** Working with User Input is a key part of most computer programming design, it allows the user to interact with the programme to make things happen.

* **How this happens in MakeCode:** Here are one or more examples of a Change Listener in  MakeCode
  - controlling the player movements
