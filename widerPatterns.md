### About this Pattern

This game pattern is one of many you can add to your Platformer in this course.

* **Name:** Change Listener

* **Description:** Also known as States, this pattern is useful when you want one part of your programme to listen out for changes in the stage of another. An example would be listening for an overlap between the player and an enemy. The programme can then take action when this overlap change happens or a particular condition is true.

* **Need for Pattern:** In many media programmes you need to change formatting or to make something happen based on the conditions of other objects. 

* **How this happens in MakeCode:** Here is an example of a Change Listener in MakeCode which listens for the player being in a condition of overlap with an Enemy.
