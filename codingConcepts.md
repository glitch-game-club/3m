# Computing Concepts

These concepts are based on the computational thinking concepts of Brennan and Resnick. They are temporarily paraphrased here and will
be fully rewritten later.

##Coding Concepts

### Sequences
A particular activity or task can be expressed as a series of steps or instructions that can be run by a computer. Like a recipe, a sequence of programming instructions specifies the action that should be happen. The order that taks happen in is significant. Some bugs are due to errors to commands being run in the wrong sequence.

### Data
Data involves storing, retrieving, and updating values. These incude: variables (to contain numbers or strings or images) and lists ( a collection of numbers or strings). Keeping score is a common way to use variables.

### Loops
We could programme an enemy to move 100 pixels to the right, wait 0.2 seconds, and then to repeat the action – moving another 10 steps, and waiting another 0.2 seconds. What if, instead of a single repetition of the action, we want the enemy to move and wait three more times? We could easily add more move and wait blocks. But what if we wanted to repeat the process 100 or 1000 more times? Loops are a way to run the same sequence many times.

### Events
Events – one thing causing another thing to happen – are an essential component of interactive
media. For example, a button triggering the beginning of a music video, or the collision of
two objects causing a game’s player to lose a life.

### Logic
Another key concept in interactive media is logic / conditionals – the ability to make decisions based on
certain conditions, which supports the expression of multiple outcomes. Operators provide support for mathematical, logical, and
string expressions, this commonly used to compare conditions before running code.


## Design Practices

These concepts are based on the computational thinking concepts of Brennan and Resnick. They also link to the adapted version of Resnick's design cycle in Gaming the System.

### Goal Setting (decision to add a new mechanic, or change space in a fundamental way)
The process of remxing a game Example activities which demonstrate this incude:
   - Invitation to set new goal or revise existing goals
   - Participant expressing a new goal to include in game or around the wider making experience
   - Clarification or questions on desired design behaviour

### Being incremental and iterative
Designing a project is not a clean, sequential process of first identifying a concept for a project,
then developing a plan for the design, and then implementing the design in code. It is an adaptive
process, one in which the plan might change in response to approaching a solution in small steps.
   - Small revisions to address the game pattern being worked on or sub goals
   - Changes which seeking to maintain or create game balance for suitable challenge level
   - Evaluating aesthetics of graphics / sound elements and revising further

### Debugging
Various testing and debugging practices are possible from learning to scan block code for error messages, to using tools to watch variables. Debugging involves different strategies for dealing with  different kinds of errors including:
   - Glitches - code still works but unexpected result (questioning
   - No errors blank screen, no idea (often retrace steps, go back to earlier version, or have to start again)
   - Clues, greyed out code, red dots, error messages (try to narrow down issue, remove sections of code, again go back, try to find duplication of code blocks)

### Playtesting
Playtesting can be of one's own game or move beyond testing ones own work to providing this service for others and acting of the feedback given by others.
Example activities which demonstrate this incude:
   - Expression of pride, or fun when playing own game
   - Imagining the user's experience of playing their game
   - Giving or receiving feedback either spontaneously or with support form a feedback / playtesting sheet

### Reusing and remixing
Building on other people’s work has been a longstanding practice in programming, and has only
been amplified by network technologies that provide access to a wide range of other people’s
work to reuse and remix.
   - Appropriation without comment or direct copying just taking the idea
   - More direct copying of code via observation or conversation

### Collaborative Production
This section is aimed at programmes where participants work together on game making as pairs or in family groups. Example activities which demonstrate this incude:
   - Refocusing: redirection back to other participants earlier goals
   - Invitation to imagine the ideal player’s experience
   - Remarks on problematic real behaviour

### Publishing and Evaluating
The process of making work public or sharing a 'finished' version with the group is a key part of the design process and one which can harness key skills of validational and evaluation in a focused way.


## 21st Century Skills including Digital Literacies

Some of the more general 21st Century Skills like communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity are covered in some of the design practices. Other very specific behaviours emerged in research on game making. The are links with 'perspectives' in Brennan and Resink which are more linked to 21st Century Skills. See also Barron's categorisation of helping behaviours around technology.

### Navigating Windows, Tabs and Internet Sites
The detail of moving from one site to another, if especially downloading images from one and then transfering to another gives rise to the chance to learn and share a variety of practices which make up key web-navigations literacies.

### Logging in and Passwords and Version Control
This category is a form of digital literacy which proficient users may take for granted. However for beginner users may need some support with this process.
Often parents as a repository for the logins and passwords of their children as well as encouraging them to save their work.  The way MakeCode doesn't support log ins
encourages a process of saving versions of your work frequently and saving them in a document, say an online google doc with dates and descriptions.
