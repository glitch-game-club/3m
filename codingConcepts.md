# Computing Concepts

These concepts are based on the computational thinking concepts of Brennan and Resnick. They are temporarily paraphrased here and will
be fully rewritten later.

##  Sequences
A particular activity or task can be expressed as a series of steps or instructions that can be run by a computer. Like a recipe, a sequence of programming instructions specifies the action that should be happen. The order that taks happen in is significant. Some bugs are due to errors to commands being run in the wrong sequence.

## Data
Data involves storing, retrieving, and updating values. These incude: variables (to contain numbers or strings or images) and lists ( a collection of numbers or strings). Keeping score is a common way to use variables.

## Loops
We could programme an enemy to move 100 pixels to the right, wait 0.2 seconds, and then
to repeat the action – moving another 10 steps, and waiting another 0.2 seconds. What if, instead
of a single repetition of the action, we want the enemy to move and wait three more times? We could
easily add more move and wait blocks. But what if we wanted to repeat the process 100
or 1000 more times? Loops are a way to run the same sequence many times.


## Events
Events – one thing causing another thing to happen – are an essential component of interactive
media. For example, a start button triggering the beginning of a music video, or the collision of
two objects causing a game’s score to increase. Figure 3 illustrates different situations in which
an event will produce an action: (1) when the green flag is clicked, the object will turn forever in
15 degree increments, (2) when the space key is pressed, the object will move up and down, and
(3) when the object is clicked with the mouse, it will display a speech bubble for 2 seconds that
says, “Hello!”

## Logic
Another key concept in interactive media is logic / conditionals – the ability to make decisions based on
certain conditions, which supports the expression of multiple outcomes. Figure 5 illustrates the
use of a conditional – the if block – to determine the visibility of an object. If the cube is
touching color yellow, then it should fade out and reappear for the next level of the game;
otherwise, it should remain visible. Operators provide support for mathematical, logical, and
string expressions, this commonly used to compare conditions before running code.
