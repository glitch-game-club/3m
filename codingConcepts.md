# Computing Concepts

These concepts are based on the computational thinking concepts of Brennan and Resnick. They are temporarily paraphrased here and will
be fully rewritten later.

##Coding Concepts

### Sequences
A particular activity or task can be expressed as a series of steps or instructions that can be run by a computer. Like a recipe, a sequence of programming instructions specifies the action that should be happen. The order that taks happen in is significant. Some bugs are due to errors to commands being run in the wrong sequence.

### Data
Data involves storing, retrieving, and updating values. These incude: variables (to contain numbers or strings or images) and lists ( a collection of numbers or strings). Keeping score is a common way to use variables.

### Loops
We could programme an enemy to move 100 pixels to the right, wait 0.2 seconds, and then to repeat the action – moving another 10 steps, and waiting another 0.2 seconds. What if, instead of a single repetition of the action, we want the enemy to move and wait three more times? We could easily add more move and wait blocks. But what if we wanted to repeat the process 100 or 1000 more times? Loops are a way to run the same sequence many times.

### Events
Events – one thing causing another thing to happen – are an essential component of interactive
media. For example, a button triggering the beginning of a music video, or the collision of
two objects causing a game’s player to lose a life.

### Logic
Another key concept in interactive media is logic / conditionals – the ability to make decisions based on
certain conditions, which supports the expression of multiple outcomes. Operators provide support for mathematical, logical, and
string expressions, this commonly used to compare conditions before running code.


## Design Practices

These concepts are based on the computational thinking concepts of Brennan and Resnick. They are temporarily paraphrased here and will
be fully rewritten later.

### Practice: Being incremental and iterative
Designing a project is not a clean, sequential process of first identifying a concept for a project,
then developing a plan for the design, and then implementing the design in code. It is an adaptive
process, one in which the plan might change in response to approaching a solution in small steps.

### Practice: Testing and debugging
Things rarely (if ever) work just as imagined; it is critical for designers to develop strategies for
dealing with – and anticipating – problems. In interviews, Scratchers described their various
testing and debugging practices, which were developed through trial and error, transfer from
other activities, or support from knowledgeable others.

### Practice: Reusing and remixing
Building on other people’s work has been a longstanding practice in programming, and has only
been amplified by network technologies that provide access to a wide range of other people’s
work to reuse and remix.

## 21st Century Skills including Digital Literacies

These emerged in research but may not be worth having as a separate category - perhaps links with 'perspectives' in Brennan and Resink which are more linked to 21st Century Skills.

### Navigating Windows, Tabs and Internet Sites
The detail of moving from one site to another, especially downloading images from one and then transfering to another.

### Logging in and Passwords
Often parents as a repository for the logins and passwords of their children.
