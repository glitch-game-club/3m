# Remixing a Platformer Game - Pattern Name

In this tutorial we will add a **patten name** ability to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. For example, is x right? 

To check that you are making the most of this pattern you can ask yourself the following questions:

* Now you have a double jump should you reduce the normal jump height (via changing the jump velocity or gravity effecting the player)
* Are there any parts of your game that you can only access via a double jump

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts. 
Find more on the [Game Pattern page](gamePatterns.md). 

Some next steps you might want to add may be x or y.
