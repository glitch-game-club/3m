# Remixing a Platformer Game - Add a timer

In this tutorial we will add a **a timer** to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

## About this Game Pattern

* **Name:** Add a Timer

* **Description:** The player is required to complete the level or another goal before the timer runs out.

* **Need for Pattern:** Having a **timer** is a way of creating challenge for the player. If you have more than one 
level you can reduce the time allowed for the next level to increase the challenge as the game progresses. 

* **Related Game Patterns:** [Add Player Lives](addLives) [related], [Add More Levels](addLevels) [related],  

* **Coding Concepts involved:** [Data](codingConcepts#data)

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** [Systems Dynamics](widerPatterns#systems-dynamics)

## How to implement this Pattern in MakeCode

### Step by Step instructions

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. 
To check that you are making the most of this pattern you can ask yourself the following question/s:

* Make sure you haven't made your game too hard or too easy get others to test it

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts. 
Find more on the [Game Pattern page](gamePatterns.md). 

Some next steps you might want to add may be add more Levels. If you do that then you will need to look at the pattern to add 
different timings for different levels.
