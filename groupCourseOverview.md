# Group Course Overview

This page gives an overview of the platform game making programme in a step by step way. It is designed to be used as a guide to
deliver the course to a group. You can work through it by yourself. There is also an online individual course here.  

## Part One - Jumping Right Inhttps://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/blob/master/courseOverview.md

### Identify Game Mechanics

We will start to understand games by playing a few arcade games and starting to look at what makes them tick. 

Play the following games ( from MakeCode )

* Galaga
* Cat Jumper
* Ballon Game
* Collect Cherries

Write down the main VERBs for these games. Pick from the following some have more than one Mechanic. 

* Jumping
* Collecting
* Avoiding
* Chasing
* Shooting

Knowing what the main mechanics for our game are and making sure that they feel fun and responsive for our player is key to making a
great game. 

### Fix the Broken Game

Now we will start coding by jumping right in. Try to play the following game. It's broken right? Now look at the code of this broken game and use the link to workshop cards with activities to fix the game and add some elements quickly.

- [Supporting Activity Cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vgHFm4zSC3YEVAXJORSoDHBFYSBIHK2mSCNfgbpiaHY/edit?usp=sharing)

At the end of the session make sure to Publish a copy of your game and to give it your own name. Keep a record of the link to your game. 
We'll come back to it next week. 

## Part Two -  Understand Games with a Game

### Playing the Game
Play a game to understand the elements of a game. There is a game called boumb an dshild which you can play with a small group
in the following way. 

* Mark out your game space, no-one can walk or run outside of that. 
* Everyone choose one person but don't say who it is. This person i your bomb
* Choose another person but don't say who it is. This person i your shield
* Everyone walk around the space but try to keep your shield between you and tyour bomb. 

Say Freeze. Stop the game and see who is safe. 
Play again, get them to swap people or choose new people. 

### Know the Elements of a Game

Outline the different elements of a game. 
* Components
* Space
* Rules
* Goal
* Mechanic

Have these written out and ask participants to try to match them with the following elements from our game.  

* Bomb, Shield, Player
* A clear space outside or in which is about the size of a room
* You are not allowed to push people out the way. 
* Win the game by staying safe by having your shield protect you from your bomb
* Walking

Explain that digital games can be analysed in the same way and that we will learn to use this knowledge to make a challenging game. 

### Goal Setting and Getting Cracking Making our Game

You are now going to meet the game we are going to adapt to create our challenging game. In part one we made changes to a broken game. We are now going to start from stratch with a similar template which is here. One key element of this game that is different, there is only one Level. 
- [Platform Game to Remix](https://makecode.com/_6630XRAuUePh)

There are different elements we can add to out game or change about our game. Each change may be small but may make big changes for the 
the person playing it. You are now going to get cracking with your game making. At the end of this session we'll do some play testing of our games. 

#### Using Game Patterns:
Game Patterns are the kind of features that we might find in many games. For example a common pattern 
you may know is that when you finish one level of a game you progress to the next level. Having a game with level is a game pattern.

Another fun way is to keep adding in different game patterns. There are many ways of thinking about these patterns
but in this guide we are dividing them up into the following:

![mechanics space polish and systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/getting-started-making-a-platformer-test1/master/images/mech_space_polish_systems.png)

- Game Mechanics:  things to do with the actions of the game
- Game Space: things to do with the layout of the game
- Game Polish: music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements
- Challenge and Systems: how different elements interact to create challenge

#### Set Goals 
Have a look at your map of the different Game Patterns. Now have a look at some of the different 
print outs or pages of the Game Patterns. There are descriptions of the patterns and details of how to add it to your platform game. 
In the last part you choose 6 patterns. This time choose only 2 and choose ones that seem to be quite quick as we are going to try 
to add them to our game before the end of the session. Fill out the Goal Setting sheet. ( Create this sheet ) 

#### Create

See the sheet and the pages to help you make the changes. These are normally step by step instructions. 
Sometimes there are places where you make your own decisions. 
Think about story of the game and the characters involved. 

#### Test

You should play your game after every change you make to see how it has changed the playing experience. 
Something on iteration. 
Something on challenge?

#### Share with Playtesting

Playtesting is a great way to really understand how the changes to your game make an impact on how the player experiences it. 
It is easy to get carried away with your own ideas and forget about the end player, so regular play testing keeps us in touch 
with what makes our game challenging and fun ot play. 

If you are doing Playtesting as a group then be sure to test a couple of games and make sure at least a couple of people test your game. 
Use this linked feedback sheet to help give feedback on games. 

If you are working through this by yourself try to find a couple of people to give you feedback. You can use the MakeCode forum as a way
of doing this. Here's how. << Add this in. 

#### Publish

Be sure to publish your work. 
Make a note of what the name of your game is. Don't have one yet then think about how to communicate what's fun about your game
or the story of your game to the players. 

#### Reflect
This is a way of really getting the most out of the making to deepen our learning and make links to other areas of making. 

There are different ways to do this, and if you are in a group you may want to make this into some kind of fun activity. See this link
for fun ideas of reflection games like ( reflection web - toss the ball ) 


***Learning notes:*** As we make changes to our game we will learn about the specific coding concepts needed to do 
computer programming, ideas like loops and logic. We'll also find links to wider patterns of computer programming and systems ideas
that are important in the world of Human Computer Interaction and Systems Thinking. 


## Part Three -  Hands on with Make Code 

### Starting Game - What kind of Game Player are you

As digital and online games became more complicated Richard Bartle proposed that different people play these games in different 
ways and look to get different things out of them. In short there are different kinds of players. The Bartle test finds out what kind of game player you are. 
Do the online Bartle Player test. You may be able to find a way of doing it as a group by moving around the room. 

This is also true of the way that people play games. There's a well known model of different play style types by Richard Bartle. This model, which was based on observing and analyzing the behaviors people playing together in a multi-user game, holds that there are four different kinds of play style interests, each of which is given a descriptive name: Griefers, Achievers, Explorers, and Socializers.1

* Griefers: interfere with the functioning of the game world or the play experience of other players
* Achievers: accumulate status tokens by beating the rules-based challenges of the game world
* Explorers: discover the systems governing the operation of the game world
* Socializers: form relationships with other players by telling stories within the game world

Different kinds of games suit different play styles. One of the notable successes of recent years have been open world games that allow you to choose how you play the game. If you want to stick to the main missions you can follow guidance to do that but if you just want to explore or be social or mess around you have the chance to to do that too.

In the same way there are different styles of making games. I'm proposing the following;

* Social makers: form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game
* Planners: like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
* Magpie makers: like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
* Glitchers: mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc

As well as different game player types, there are also different game maker types. These are listed here, but if you are a 
planner then you may want to really know how all of the code for our game works before you start to make other changes to it. 

So if you are a planner then you may want to take the time to work your way through these tutorials. If not jump right on to the 
next section.

### Setting New Goals and Reflecting on Progress 

We are going to follow the same pattern of last week:

* Set goals to add chosen game patterns
* Follow the coding help to make the changes you need
* Test the game yourself imagining the end player's experience
* Playtest other people's game and get feedback for yours
* Reflect on our progress

## Part Four -  Debugging and more 

### Types of errors and dealing with them. 

Can this be made into a game of some kind ?
There are different kinds of that you may come up against. Knowing how to deal with them is a good tactic to keep us progressing.
