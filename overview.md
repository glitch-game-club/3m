# Overview of Remixing Platformer

## Introduction
### Introduction

This course is built on the simple idea of starting with a platform game and adding familiar
game patterns and features.

A good starting point is this templage to remix from.

The following two links are a similar / but broken game and a link to workshop cards with activities to add to this game.

## Next Steps
### Choose your own adventure

One way to learn coding in depth is to learn how to *make the sample game from scratch* and you can do that
in the next section called *Tutorial to create game from scratch*.

Another fun way is to keep adding in different game patterns. There are many ways of thinking about these patterns
but in this guide we are dividing them up into the following:

- Game Mechanics:  things to do with the actions of the game
- Game Space: things to do with the layout of the game
- Game Polish: music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements
- Challenge and Systems: how different elements interact to create challenge

## First Principles Tutorials
### Tutorial to create game from scratch

These tutorials build up the platform game in a step by step way. Follow them to learn
the mechanics of the building blocks of the make code system.

- [Tutorial Part One](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/partOne)
- [Tutorial Part Two](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:github:mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/tutorialPartTwo)

This intention is not to teach the underlying concepts of computer science.
