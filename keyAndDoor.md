# Remixing a Platformer Game - Key and Door

In this tutorial we will add a key to open a end door to our platformer levels.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

## About this Game Pattern

![keys and doors](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/master/images/patterns/gameSpace_keysDoors.jpg)

* **Name:** Key and Door

* **Description:** The player needs to collect a key before they can exit the level of the platformer game. 

* **Need for Pattern:** Having a **Key and Door** is a common pattern which adds to a sense of exploration to the game. You can use this in 
combination with using points to collect other objects. 

* **Related Game Patterns:** Add Static Enemy [needed before adding this one], Jumping on Enemies [related] 

* **Coding Concepts involved:** [Data](learningDimensions#data), [Loops](learningDimensions#loops), [Events](learningDimensions#events)

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** , [Change Listener](learningDimensions#change-listener), [Input Event](learningDimensions#input-event), [Systems Dynamics](learningDimensions#systems-dynamics)

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. For example, is x right? 

To check that you are making the most of this pattern you can ask yourself the following questions:

* Now you have a double jump should you reduce the normal jump height (via changing the jump velocity or gravity effecting the player)
* Are there any parts of your game that you can only access via a double jump

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts.

Some next steps you might want to add may be x or y.
