# Remixing a Platformer Game - Moving Enemies Pt1 (Patrolling)

In this tutorial we will add a **patrolling enemy** ability to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

## About this Game Pattern

![ moving enemies image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/getting-started-making-a-platformer-test1/master/images/patterns/gameMechanics_moving_enemies.jpg)

* **Name:** Patrolling Enemies

* **Description:** In this pattern the enemy moves around in a particular area in a repeating pattern. This movement is called patrolling
and the enemy does not try to seek out the player. 

* **Need for Pattern:** Having a **pattern name** is a way to increase the challenge of the player to reach goals and to collect food.
It also gives a sense of movement and excitement to the game. 

* **Related Game Patterns:** Add Static Enemy [related], Jumping on Enemies [related] 

* **Coding Concepts involved:** [Data](learningDimensions#data),  [Events](learningDimensions#events)

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** , [Change Listener](learningDimensions#change-listener), [Systems Dynamics](learningDimensions#systems-dynamics)

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. 

To check that you are making the most of this pattern you can ask yourself the following questions:

* Are your blocks placed in the right place to make sure you enemies patrol in the right places
* Can place patrolling enemies towards the end of your game in a way that makes it tricky to get past them?

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts. 
Find more on the [Game Pattern page](gamePatterns.md). 

This pattern may make your game much more challenging. To balance it out a potential next step may be to 
add the Jump on Enemies pattern to your game if you haven't already.
