# Course Overview

This page gives an overview of the platform game making programme in a step by step way. It can be used as a guide to
deliver the course to a group or to work through it by yourself. 

## Part One - Jumping Right In

Start this course by jumping right in. Try to play the following game. It's broken right? Now look at the code of this broken game and use the link to workshop cards with activities to fix the game and add some elements quickly.

- [Supporting Activity Cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vgHFm4zSC3YEVAXJORSoDHBFYSBIHK2mSCNfgbpiaHY/edit?usp=sharing)

At the end of the session make sure to Publish a copy of your game and to give it your own name. Keep a record of the link to your game. 
We'll come back to it next week. 

## Part Two -  Understand Games with a Game

### Playing the Game
Play a game to understand the elements of a game. There is a game called boumb an dshild which you can play with a small group
in the following way. 

* Mark out your game space, no-one can walk or run outside of that. 
* Everyone choose one person but don't say who it is. This person i your bomb
* Choose another person but don't say who it is. This person i your shield
* Everyone walk around the space but try to keep your shield between you and tyour bomb. 

Say Freeze. Stop the game and see who is safe. 
Play again, get them to swap people or choose new people. 

### Know the Elements of a Game

Outline the different elements of a game. 
* Components
* Space
* Rules
* Goal
* Mechanic

Have these written out and ask participants to try to match them with the following elements from our game.  

* Bomb, Shield, Player
* A clear space outside or in which is about the size of a room
* You are not allowed to push people out the way. 
* Win the game by staying safe by having your shield protect you from your bomb
* Walking

Explain that digital games can be analysed in the same way and that we will learn to use this knowledge to make a challenging game. 

### Setting some Goals 

You are now going to meet the game we are going to adapt to create our challenging game. In part one we made changes to a broken game. We are now going to start from stratch with a similar template which is here -
- [Platform Game to Remix](https://makecode.com/_6630XRAuUePh)

There are different elements we can add to out game or change about our game. Each change may be small but may make big changes for the 
the person playing it. 

Have a look at the print out cards from part one. Quickly add your changes back to the game. There are some elements that you won't
be able to change as it is different. For example there is only one Level. 

Here is a map of some of the elements you may add to your game. Choose 6 elements that you think you will want to add. 

## Part Three -  Hands on with Make Code 

### Starting Game - What kind of Game Player are you

As digital and online games became more complicated Richard Bartle proposed that different people play these games in different 
ways and look to get different things out of them. In short there are different kinds of players. The Bartle test finds out what kind of game player you are. 
Do the online Bartle Player test. You may be able to find a way of doing it as a group by moving around the room. 

As well as different game player types, there are also different game maker types. These are listed here, but if you are a 
planner then you may want to really know how all of the code for our game works before you start to make other changes to it. 

### Goal Setting and Getting Cracking

You are now going to get cracking with your game making. At the end of this session we'll do some play testing of our games. 

***Game Patterns:*** Game Patterns are the kind of features that we might find in many games. For example a common pattern 
you may know is that when you finish one level of a game you progress to the next level. Having a game with level is a game pattern.

***Goal Setting;*** Have a look at your map of the different Game Patterns from last week. Now have a look at some of the different 
print outs or pages of the Game Patterns. There are descriptions of the patterns and details of how to add it to your platform game. 
In the last part you choose 6 patterns. This time choose only 3 and choose ones that seem to be quite quick as we are going to try 
to add them to our game before the end of the session. 

***Learning notes:*** As we make changes to our game we will learn about the specific coding concepts needed to do 
computer programming, ideas like loops and logic. We'll also find links to wider patterns of computer programming and systems ideas
that are important in the world of Human Computer Interaction and Systems Thinking. 

### Playtesting

If you are doing this as a group then be sure to test a couple of games and make sure at least a couple of people test your game. 
Use the linked feedback sheet to help give feedback on games. 

## Part Four -  Debugging and more 

### Types of errors and dealing with them. 

There are different kinds of that you may come up against. Knowing how to deal with them is a good tactic to keep us progressing.
