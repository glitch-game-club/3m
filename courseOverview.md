# Course Overview

This page gives an overview of the platform game making programme in a step by step way. It can be used as a guide to
deliver the course to a group or to work through it by yourself. 

## Part One - Jumping Right In

Start this course by jumping right in. Try to play the following game. It's broken right? Now look at the code of this broken game and use the link to workshop cards with activities to fix the game and add some elements quickly.

- [Supporting Activity Cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vgHFm4zSC3YEVAXJORSoDHBFYSBIHK2mSCNfgbpiaHY/edit?usp=sharing)

At the end of the session make sure to Publish a copy of your game and to give it your own name. Keep a record of the link to your game. 
We'll come back to it next week. 

## Part Two -  Understand Games with a Game

### Playing the Game
Play a game to understand the elements of a game. There is a game called boumb an dshild which you can play with a small group
in the following way. 

* Mark out your game space, no-one can walk or run outside of that. 
* Everyone choose one person but don't say who it is. This person i your bomb
* Choose another person but don't say who it is. This person i your shield
* Everyone walk around the space but try to keep your shield between you and tyour bomb. 

Say Freeze. Stop the game and see who is safe. 
Play again, get them to swap people or choose new people. 

### Know the Elements of a Game

Outline the different elements of a game. 
* Components
* Space
* Rules
* Goal
* Mechanic

Have these written out and ask participants to try to match them with the following elements from our game.  

* Bomb, Shield, Player
* A clear space outside or in which is about the size of a room
* You are not allowed to push people out the way. 
* Win the game by staying safe by having your shield protect you from your bomb
* Walking

Explain that digital games can be analysed in the same way and that we will learn to use this knowledge to make a challenging game. 

### Setting some Goals 

You are now going to meet the game we are going to adapt to create our challenging game. In part one we made changes to a broken game

## Part Three -  Hands on with Make Code 

### Starting Game - What kind of Game Player are you

Do the online Bartle Player test. Or find a way of doing it as a group. 

### Revisit Goal Setting and Getting Cracking

You are now going to get cracking with your game making. At the end of this session we'll d

Link to the the specific coding Concepts. 
And links to wider patterns. 

### Playtesting

If you are doing this as a group then be sure to test a couple of games and make sure at least a couple of people test your game. 
Use the linked feedback sheet to help give feedback on games. 

## Part Four -  Debugging and more 

### Types of errors and dealing with them.
