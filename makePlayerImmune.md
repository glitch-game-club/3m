# Remixing a Platformer Game - Pattern Name

In this tutorial we will add a **patten name** ability to our platformer.
If you want to understand more about how the starting code of the template works then you can follow [this tutorial](https://arcade.makecode.com/beta#tutorial:https://github.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101)
 to create the game step by step.

## About this Game Pattern

![mechanics space polish and systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/makecode-platformer-101/master/images/patterns/gameMechanics_more_levels.jpg)

* **Name:** Make Player Immune from Enemies

* **Description:** The player is not able to be zapped by enemies.

* **Need for Pattern:** Having a **player immunity** is often needed if you have a system of lives. If you lose a life
but don't move your player back to the start in a safe place, then the continuing overlap will cause you to lose all your
lives at once. 

* **Related Game Patterns:** Add Static Enemy [related], Add Player Lives [related],

* **Coding Concepts involved:** [Events](learningDimensions#events)

* **Links to other Computing Patterns:** , [Change Listener](learningDimensions#change-listener), 

## How to implement this Pattern in MakeCode

## Test your Changes and Next Steps

Test your game to check that your changes have the desired behaviour and that there are no side effects. 

To check that you are making the most of this pattern you can ask yourself the following questions:

* Is the length of delay right or does it need to be longer or shorter? 

This Game Pattern is one of many allowing you to make improvements to your platform game and to learn coding and wider computing concepts.
