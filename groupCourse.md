# Group Course Overview

This page gives an overview of a five session platform game making programme. It is designed to be used as a guide to
deliver the course to a group. You can work through it by yourself. There is also an [online individual course here](onlineCourse.md).  

* [Session One](#session-one)
* [Session Two](#session-two)
* [Session Three](#session-three)
* [Session Four](#session-four)
* [Session Five](#session-five)

## Session One - Jumping Right In

### Identify Game Mechanics

We will start to understand games by playing a few arcade games and starting to look at what makes them tick.
On entry participants play the following games ( from MakeCode )

* Galaga
* Ballon Game
* Duck Run
* Eat Fruit
* Level Up

Write down the main VERBs for these games. Pick from the following some have more than one Mechanic.

* Jumping
* Collecting
* Avoiding
* Chasing
* Shooting

Knowing what the main mechanics for our game are and making sure that they feel fun and responsive for our player is key to making a
great game.

### Fix the Broken Game

Now we will start coding by jumping right in. Try to play the following game. It's broken right? Now look at the code of this broken game and use the link to workshop cards with activities to fix the game and add some elements quickly.

- [Supporting Activity Cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vgHFm4zSC3YEVAXJORSoDHBFYSBIHK2mSCNfgbpiaHY/edit?usp=sharing)

At the end of the session make sure to Publish a copy of your game and to give it your own name.
Keep a record of the link to your game. We'll come back to it next week.

### Reflection on Session One

Play a quick reflection game to find out what people thought and got out of the first session. The [Reflection Web](https://pblactivities.wordpress.com/2018/09/03/reflection-web/) is a fun one to start with. Ask the following questions.

* Share something you found fun
* Share something you found hard
* Share something that surprised you

### Homework - What kind of Game Player are you

As digital and online games became more complicated Richard Bartle proposed that different people play these games in different
ways and look to get different things out of them. In short there are different kinds of players. The Bartle test finds out what kind of game player you are. **[Do the online Bartle Player test.](http://matthewbarr.co.uk/bartle/)** You may be able to find a way of doing it as a group by moving around the room.

This is also true of the way that people play games. There's a well known model of different play style types by Richard Bartle. This model, which was based on observing and analyzing the behaviors people playing together in a multi-user game, holds that there are four different kinds of play style interests, each of which is given a descriptive name: Griefers, Achievers, Explorers, and Socializers.

* Griefers: interfere with the functioning of the game world or the play experience of other players
* Achievers: accumulate status tokens by beating the rules-based challenges of the game world
* Explorers: discover the systems governing the operation of the game world
* Socializers: form relationships with other players by telling stories within the game world

Different kinds of games suit different play styles. One of the notable successes of recent years have been open world games that allow you to choose how you play the game. If you want to stick to the main missions you can follow guidance to do that but if you just want to explore or be social or mess around you have the chance to to do that too.

In the same way there are different styles of making games. I'm proposing the following;

* Social makers: form relationships with other game makers and players by finding out more about their work and telling stories in their game
* Planners: like to study to get a full knowledge of the tools and what is possible before they build up their game step-by-step
* Magpie makers: like trying out lots of different things and happy to borrow code, images and sound from anywhere for quick results
* Glitchers: mess around with the code trying to see if they can break it interesting ways and cause a bit of havoc

As well as different game player types, there are also different game maker types. These are listed here, but if you are a
planner then you may want to really know how all of the code for our game works before you start to make other changes to it.

## Session Two -  Understand Games with a Game

### Matching Games to Code

On entry participants play the following games ( from MakeCode )

* Galaga
* Duck Run
* Eat Fruit
* Level Up

The next activity is to try to match cut out screen grabs to each of the games. [See print outs here] (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NEh-YHlNO_yr7lBx1tVySml-ZkvDtpbp).

Additionally as a bonus can you see any of the following:

* Variables
* Loops
* Logic
* Events

#### Step by Step Tutorials for the Planners out there
If you are a planner then you may want to take the time to work your way through these tutorials.
If not jump right on to the next section.

### Goal Setting and Getting Cracking Making our Game

#### Adding Game Patterns to a Starting Template

In part one we made changes by adding features called [Game Patterns](gamePatterns) to a broken game. We are now going to start from stratch with a similar [Platform Game Template to Remix](https://makecode.com/_FqWD64MxEiRi). It is a bit
simpler, for example there is only one level and you don't have to collect all food before winning.
There are many ways of thinking about these patterns but in this guide we are dividing them up into the following:

![mechanics space polish and systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/getting-started-making-a-platformer-test1/master/images/mech_space_polish_systems.png)

- Game Mechanics:  things to do with the actions of the game
- Game Space: things to do with the layout of the game
- Game Polish: music, backgrounds, graphics and story elements
- Challenge and Systems: how different elements interact to create challenge

Find a fuller list of the different [Game Patterns and how to apply them on this Page](gamePatterns).

#### Starting our Creative Design Sessions

The sessions are informal and different participants will be doing different things at different times.
However there is a general pattern to help organise the chaos of our game making sessions.
The sessions are based around the following pattern.

***Set Goals***  Have a look at the list of the different [Game Patterns](gamePatterns). Each Game Pattern has it's own page.
with descriptions of the patterns and details of how to add it to your platform game.
For now choose 2 patterns to add to your game. Choose at least one that you think will be quick to implement.
We will add them to our game before the end of the session. Fill out the Goal Setting sheet. ( Create this sheet )

***Create*** See the sheet and the pages to help you make the changes. These are normally step by step instructions.
Sometimes there are places where you make your own decisions.
Think about story of the game and the characters involved.

***Test*** You should play your game after every change you make to see how it has changed the playing experience.
Keep in mind the experience of the end player when you are testing your game. Also try to think about the right level of
challenge for your game.

***Share with Playtesting*** Playtesting is a great way to really understand how the changes to your game make an impact on how the player experiences it. If you are doing Playtesting as a group then be sure to test a couple of games and make sure at least a couple of people test your game.
Use this linked feedback sheet to help give feedback on games. << ADD SHEET

***Publish*** Be sure to publish your work using the share link in the top right of the MakeCode edit screen. Give your game a name and ideally a
version name. A good name communicates what's fun about your game or its story to your audience.
You can also use the MakeCode forum as a way of getting feedback this. To do this click on the image of the speech bubbles.

![mechanics space polish and systems](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickfuzz/getting-started-making-a-platformer-test1/master/images/publish.png)

***Reflect*** Reflecting on our progress allows us to getting the most out of the making to deepen our learning and make links to other areas of making.

There are different ways to do this, and if you are in a group you may want to make this into some kind of fun activity. See this link
for fun ideas of reflection games like reflection web.

***Learning notes:*** As we make changes to our game we will learn about the specific coding concepts needed to do
computer programming, ideas like loops and logic. We'll also find links to wider patterns of computer programming and systems ideas
that are important in the world of Human Computer Interaction and Systems Thinking.

## Session Three

### Playing the Game
Play a game to understand the elements of a game. There is a game called boumb an dshild which you can play with a small group
in the following way.

* Mark out your game space, no-one can walk or run outside of that.
* Everyone choose one person but don't say who it is. This person i your bomb
* Choose another person but don't say who it is. This person i your shield
* Everyone walk around the space but try to keep your shield between you and tyour bomb.

Say Freeze. Stop the game and see who is safe.
Play again, get them to swap people or choose new people.

### Know the Elements of a Game

Outline the different elements of a game which can be changed by the designer to change the nature of the game.

* Components - the nouns of the game for example for a platformer (player, collectable food, enemies, end goal sprite, )
* Mechanics - the verbs of the game (walking, jumping, collecting)
* Space - changes to the layout of the game (location of platforms, )
* Rules
* Goal

Have these written out and ask participants to try to match them with the following elements from our game.  

* Bomb, Shield, Player
* A clear space outside or in which is about the size of a room
* You are not allowed to push people out the way.
* Win the game by staying safe by having your shield protect you from your bomb
* Walking

Explain that digital games can be analysed in the same way and that we will learn to use this knowledge to make a challenging game.

### Hands on Making

### Creative Design Game Making Session

Follow the Creative Design Game Making Session pattern as outlined in week two.

* Set goals to add chosen game patterns
* Follow the coding help to make the changes you need
* Test the game yourself imagining the end player's experience
* Playtest other people's game and get feedback for yours
* Reflect on our progress

This week add in the following element to goals setting.

***Extra Mission Cards*** These extra missions encourage us to think of our games as dynamic systems that change as we play the game.  
[Mission Cards for this Sessions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tKr8kWzoI6Hdn1zHPHmDP7hd4C_G12PSkwUP-Zsw69s/edit)

### Reflection Activity

Something to do with challenge and systems.

### Homework
Try to add in as much as you can between sessions. Bring any problems to the next session.

## Session Four  

### Types of errors and dealing with them.

Can this be made into a game of some kind ?
There are different kinds of that you may come up against. Knowing how to deal with them is a good tactic to keep us progressing.

* Errors
* Blank Screen Errors
* Glitches

Learn to celebrate glitches. Find out what is happening in the following projects. What type of error are they?
How can you solve them?

### Creative Design Game Making Session

Follow the Creative Design Game Making Session pattern as outlined in week two.

In terms of goal setting. What is becoming special about your game. What are the final changes you want to make?
Use the following check list to make quick changes to your game.

* Do you have a strong story for your game? Can you add one?
* Have you applied a Mission Card or a system pattern yet?
* Have you got a balanced of game patterns added?

### Reflection

What are the final changes you want to make for the last session?  

### Homework
Try not to add any more to your game in terms of new patterns. Focus as much as you can on the playability of your game.

## Session Five

### Playability Tweaking and Hardware

Ask participants to send games via emails so they may be loaded up onto computer or hand helds.
You may want to run a session on making a console with computer electronics including hardware elements of arcade buttons.

In arranging the hardware for showcasing you may encourange last minute changes based on facilitator feedback.

### Showcasing

Have in place a form which allows participants to reflect on the final product, player reactions.

### Reflection

* What are your final takeaways?
* Share about your changes in confidence in use of specifics of coding concepts.
* What do you feel you've learned about wider patterns - computer programming/ systems designs.
